## RotMGTool. (W.I.P)
This is supposed to be a content management tool for RotMG private servers. You attach all the directories needed, and then you will be able to do the following.
**1.** Generate XMLs for items, enemies, and other objects thru. GUI, then be able to 'Save' the .xml, updating it in both your server/client directory.
**2.** Create spritesheets and import them to your server/client with just a .png.
**3.** Append snippets of spritesheets or individual items onto an existing spritesheet.
