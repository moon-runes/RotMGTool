## RotMGTool. (W.I.P)
This is supposed to be a content management tool for RotMG private servers. You'd attach all the directories as prompted, then you'll be able to add content, whether it'd be sprites or objects through GUI. No having to manually edit files. For more information, these are the three goals I'm trying to accomplish with RotMGTool. <br /> <br />
**1.** Generate XMLs for items, enemies, and other objects thru. GUI, then be able to 'Save' the .xml, updating it in both your server/client directory. <br />
**2.** Create spritesheets and import them to your server/client with just a .png. <br />
**3.** Append snippets of spritesheets or individual items onto an existing spritesheet. <br />
